#   Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

def sub_strings(text, dictionary)
  text = text.downcase
  counts = Hash.new(0)

  dictionary.each do |word|
    matches = text.scan(word)
    counts[word] = matches.length unless matches.empty?
  end
  counts
end

                part partner sit]
text = "Howdy partner, sit down! How's it going? It is going low."
